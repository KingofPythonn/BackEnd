Just a heads up and a tip for those of you who are struggling to make sense of whats happening under the hood.  If you've found this section somewhat confusing and difficult to grasp,  or perhaps you've been bamboozled by all the code then my advice to you is to have a primer on Javascript Objects, Methods and Properties.  Lot of whats going on in the route handlers are using objects and their methods and properties.

Once you grasp this fundamental your life will become a lot easier.  Rather than just give code and screenshots I feel the best way to help anyone learn is to guide them in the right direction whilst encouraging them to THINK and LEARN themselves during the process. This was not a response to anyones question or comment on here, rather it was just my way of helping those who may have come here in search of help but remained lost.
