May I recommend a course here on Udemy? Then check out React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (English language). It gives you answers your are looking for. Very good course.

I guess install "Node.js Modules Intellisense" inside VS code will solve this issue 

Two different things.

You can bring the SOURCE CODE to GitHub anytime you want by simply creating a new repository online, set up a local GIT on your local computer, push the code, etc, etc (as in the usual drill).

However, to host a dynamic site online you need an additional service such as Render.com (have a look at it and search for instructions for publishing a Node JS based site).

All the best,
