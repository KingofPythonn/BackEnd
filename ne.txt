May I recommend a course here on Udemy? Then check out React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (English language). It gives you answers your are looking for. Very good course.

I guess install "Node.js Modules Intellisense" inside VS code will solve this issue
